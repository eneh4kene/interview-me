# Security Protocols SOP

## 📋 Overview

This SOP outlines comprehensive security protocols for the InterviewsFirst platform, covering all aspects of data protection, access control, and security incident response.

## 🎯 Purpose

To ensure the highest level of security for client data, platform integrity, and compliance with data protection regulations.

## 🔒 Security Framework

### **Security Principles**
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Least Privilege**: Minimum necessary access for all users
- **Zero Trust**: Verify every access request
- **Data Protection**: Encrypt data at rest and in transit
- **Incident Response**: Rapid detection and response to threats

### **Compliance Requirements**
- **GDPR**: General Data Protection Regulation
- **CCPA**: California Consumer Privacy Act
- **SOC 2**: Security, Availability, Processing Integrity
- **ISO 27001**: Information Security Management

## 🔐 Access Control

### **Authentication Systems**

#### **JWT Token Management**
```bash
# JWT Configuration
JWT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=./private.pem
JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH=./public.pem
JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY=15m
JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY=7d

# Token Rotation
# Access tokens expire every 15 minutes
# Refresh tokens expire every 7 days
# Automatic token rotation on refresh
```

#### **Password Security**
```bash
# Password Requirements
- Minimum 12 characters
- At least 1 uppercase letter
- At least 1 lowercase letter
- At least 1 number
- At least 1 special character
- No common passwords
- No personal information

# Password Hashing
- Algorithm: bcrypt
- Cost factor: 12
- Salt rounds: 12
```

#### **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
```bash
# MFA Implementation
- TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)
- SMS verification (backup)
- Email verification (backup)
- Hardware security keys (optional)

# MFA Requirements
- Required for admin accounts
- Required for payment operations
- Optional for regular users
```

### **Authorization Levels**

#### **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
```sql
-- User roles and permissions
CREATE TABLE user_roles (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    permissions JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Role definitions
INSERT INTO user_roles (role, permissions) VALUES
('admin', '{"all": true}'),
('worker', '{"clients": ["read", "write"], "applications": ["read", "write"], "jobs": ["read"]}'),
('client', '{"profile": ["read", "write"], "applications": ["read"], "resumes": ["read", "write"]}');
```

#### **API Access Control**
```bash
# API Rate Limiting
- General endpoints: 100 requests/minute
- Authentication endpoints: 5 requests/minute
- File upload endpoints: 10 requests/minute
- Job search endpoints: 50 requests/minute

# IP Whitelisting
- Admin access: Specific IP ranges only
- API access: Rate-limited by IP
- Geographic restrictions: Configurable by region
```

## 🛡️ Data Protection

### **Encryption Standards**

#### **Data at Rest**
```bash
# Database Encryption
- PostgreSQL: Full database encryption
- File Storage: AES-256 encryption
- Backup Storage: Encrypted backups
- Log Files: Encrypted sensitive data

# Key Management
- Encryption keys: Stored in secure key management system
- Key rotation: Quarterly key rotation
- Key backup: Secure backup of encryption keys
```

#### **Data in Transit**
```bash
# Transport Layer Security (TLS)
- TLS 1.3 required for all connections
- HTTPS only for web traffic
- API communications: TLS 1.3
- Database connections: TLS 1.3

# Certificate Management
- SSL certificates: 90-day rotation
- Certificate monitoring: Automated expiry alerts
- Certificate validation: Strict validation
```

### **Data Classification**

#### **Data Sensitivity Levels**
```bash
# PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
- HIGH: Names, emails, phone numbers, addresses
- MEDIUM: Job preferences, salary expectations
- LOW: Public job listings, company information

# Data Handling Requirements
- HIGH: Encrypted storage, restricted access, audit logging
- MEDIUM: Encrypted storage, role-based access
- LOW: Standard security measures
```

#### **Data Retention Policies**
```sql
-- Data retention configuration
CREATE TABLE data_retention_policies (
    data_type VARCHAR(100) PRIMARY KEY,
    retention_period_days INTEGER,
    deletion_method VARCHAR(50),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Retention policies
INSERT INTO data_retention_policies VALUES
('client_profiles', 2555, 'secure_deletion'), -- 7 years
('application_data', 1095, 'secure_deletion'), -- 3 years
('job_listings', 30, 'standard_deletion'), -- 30 days
